# Client

This is the client for the project. It is a simple web application that uses the server to get data and display it.

It's a simple javascript application that uses Bootstrap 5 and Vite to build the application.
This project has been created by following the [Bootstrap & Vite official guide](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/vite/).

## Dependencies

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## How to run

To run the client, you need to have the server running. You can find the server in the `server` folder.
The project can be built using `yarn` or `npm`. The following commands are available:

- `yarn start dev`: Run the development server
- `yarn start build`: Build the project for production

## Notes

In folder `dist` there is a `index.html` file that is used to serve the application. This file is generated by Vite and it's not meant to be edited manually.
It uses absolute paths to load the assets and it's meant to be served from the root of the server.
